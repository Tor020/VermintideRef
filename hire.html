            <p>Since taking on my first freelance client, I've decided that while I would still appreciate donations, the thing that would benefit me far more is help getting a job.</p>
            
             <p>With that in mind, I've remade this page to be about who I am how you can help me get hired.</p>

        <div class="well">
           <p>My name is Kevin Coyle, I'm 26 years old and was born and currently live in Ohio</p>
            <p>Unsurprisingly, I've spent a fair amount of time recently looking into this matter of getting hired as a self taught Front End Web developer. I've spent a couple of months looking for a job now and have two primary conclusions as to why I've had no success. </p>
               
            <ol>
                <li>I live in Ohio.</li>
                <li>It's difficult to network in my location.</li>
            </ol>
                <p>Overall the first point is less important than the second. There are still Web Developer jobs in Ohio, but there are much fewer on average than other states and it doesn't help at all that I live <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/North+Ridgeville,+OH/@40.8712797,-83.9200276,7.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x8830973ec6abc9bf:0xdcd1f77b5dd061d3!8m2!3d41.3894905!4d-82.0190321">here</a> in Ohio. </p>
                
                <p> <strong>You can help me by referring me to anyone you know that's interested in hiring a Front End Web Developer who can work remotely.</strong></p>

           <p> Because I'm a self taught developer that has real experience making useful and practical webpages. Most of my experience prior to making this website came from around 200 lessons at <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/tor020">Free Code Camp</a> and a few miscellaneous youtube tutorials.</p> 
           
           <p>This was really the first website I'd ever built with the intention of other people seeing/using when I decided I wanted to be a developer. I had done these calculations myself several times on the built in calculator that comes with Windows but it was always tedious. Then I figured out that it would be useful to make a website that did this for you. I realized that it wouldn't be too difficult to make the calculations occur by thinking about what I knew already. However, I also did know that I would have to learn more to make the functionality of taking inputs from a user on the page as well as figuring out how to output the information to the page I won't say that part was easy. Everything I learned I had to push myself to learn and I didn't have anybody to ask for help from. I worked hard and ultimately made the website you see here, which I am continually trying to improve as I learn more.</p>
           
          
            
             <p> Since then, I've made <a href="https://tor020.github.io/Online_Archiv/index.html">made</a> more websites and have done a lot more things in general with web development. I've  I made this website by myself and after receiving feedback from the community. I'm self motivated enough to push myself to keep learning new things not only because I find it enjoyable and interesting, but also so that I can do a better job doing it. I'm interested and willing to handle smaller projects as the only developer, but am also interested in working on a team. You can find more on my <a href="https://tor020.github.io/">portfolio website.</a>
